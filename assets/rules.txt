__**Welcome to the MLP-VectorClub's Discord Server!**__
The server's canonical invite link is <{{INVITE_LINK}}>

We have a few rules that you should keep in mind:

**1.** Everyone is welcome; you don't have to be an artist/musician/writer to be part of the conversation. However, if you *are* a member of our DeviantArt group, please tell us (along with your DeviantArt name) so we can assign you the appropriate nickname and role.

**2.** If you are member of our DeviantArt group, or if you interact with the club frequently, we'll give you a nickname that matches your DA name. This is to make it easier to find you on the server in case we need to contact you. If you want to keep your Discord name visible, you can use the `/fixnick` command.

**3.** Kindly try to keep topics in their respective channels. Use your notification settings (Screenshot: <https://bit.ly/2VKoQdZ>) to mute any channels from which you don't want to receive new notifications.
    #CASUAL: The place for general discussion. You can share art, music, or funny pictures with the rest of the members.
    #GAMES: For all things gaming. If you want to notify others about game deals and discounts this is the place to do so.
    #VECTORS: Vector artwork helpline - you can ask for critique on or help with your vectors here. You can use the `/vectorapp` command to give yourself roles that let others know what application you make vectors with.
    #SUPPORT: Questions about the color guide website, the DeviantArt group and the Discord server should go here.
    #SPOILERS: Talk about upcoming or recently aired episodes and movies, as well as the comics.
    #SUPER_SPOILERS: This channel is only open when major leaks happen to avoid posting such content in #SPOILERS
    #BOT_SANDBOX: Play around with the features of @me without disrupting the conversation in other channels.
    #NSFW: Discussions of adult material. You will be given a warning message by Discord on your first visit which you'll need to acknowledge before you can chat here.

**4.** We have a zero tolerance policy for harassment and impersonation on the server, if you have received inappropriate DMs from server members or fell victim to an impersonator do not hesitate to contact any one of our staff members.
